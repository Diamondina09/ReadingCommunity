Process of creating this website:

Ideation:
I wanted to create reading community based webpage due to my reading hobbies. I wanted to create a quiz page that was easily accessible and readable that would encourage people to read.
I made sure to make it for different kinds of readers, from people who do not pick up a book at all to avid readers, giving recommendations that encompassed their interests and their habits.
Additionally, I created a page on a website with more recommendations for those who wanted to check out new suggestions or challenge themselves to read more. 

My inspiration came from quizzes I would do when I was bored. This included Buzzfeed quizzes, that would be simple in design through offering few short choices and based on how many of a 
certain kind of choice the user chose an answer would pop up. These quizzes ranged from what character the user most aligned with to movie recommendations for the user based on their choices. 
This formatting to me was cool and addictive to me as it was a simplistic format and quick to complete unlike other quiz websites. 


Website Process:
I chose a simple aesthetic to not make it complicated for the user. The limited color palette also added to this. I decided to change the mouse when hovering over options to add a cool touch
to the website and make it fun for users. 

While I was happy with the outcome, I feel that there were many improvements I could have done. I felt that I should have added images for the results page of the book covers to give users
an idea of which books to look for as there may be books with similar titles and the user may have confusion trying to find them. Overall, this project gave me an idea on how to create a quiz. 
I feel that I could try a more experimentative approach in terms of designing the layout of the webpage.
